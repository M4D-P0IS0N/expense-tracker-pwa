## 🔒 Security

- Environment variables are **never committed** — `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- Supabase credentials in production are injected via **GitHub Secrets**
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** ensures users can only access their own data
- Any table exposed in the `public` schema must have **RLS enabled and explicit policies**
- Service Worker **excludes Supabase API calls** from caching
- Auth Guard redirects unauthenticated users to the login page
